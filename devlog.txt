Started the C++ project since Mr. Polizano allowed me to use languages other than Java.
Didn't really make any progress since it was my dad's 50th birthday.

Started working in class. First thing I did was translate my handy ReadAndWrite class that I had in Java
to a C++ class. I finished that pretty easily. Now I'm going to take an object oriented approach to my menu system.
I started by creating a menu interface, and then proceeded to create the Main Menu class. That's about all I did in
class. I'm not expecting to do any more work today unfortunately since I have a Calculus quiz tomorrow and a
physical engineering project due as well.
